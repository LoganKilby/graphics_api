/*
Allocators
  - For a block allocator, could include the # of bytes allocated as part of the memory, maybe in a few bytes at the end. When stepping backwards through the allocations. Hypotheticall I could check that size, step backwards 'size' bytes and be at the previous allocation, and
be able to repeat that for all allocations.
